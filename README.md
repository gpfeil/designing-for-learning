# designing-for-learning
Welcome to *Designing for Learning* — a living body of work dedicated to framing **UX and service design as adaptive systems** that improve over time. As such, it treats design(s) as **a form of social practice** in which form is continuously (read iteratively) recreated **in use**. In this repository, I share essays, frameworks, case excerpts, and experiment-driven reflections that explore how design decisions become better through iteration, measurement, and thoughtful practice. In short, how design can learn from other systems of meaningful practice and how those learnings can inform high-value uses of ML and agentic AI in UX.

Rather than treating design as a one-off deliverable, this work positions it as a **continuous learning system** where hypotheses are stated explicitly, outcomes are measured in production, and every version contributes to deeper understanding. Here you’ll find structured thinking on systems, metrics, mental models, and service design practice that suggest practical application and demonstrate value of considering **design, research, and learning** not as separate moments in delivery, but as distinct perspectives on a shared object: the product as a tool in use. 

The approach is informed by Peircean semiotics as a model of meaning in practice, evolving in use. A design, like any other sign in Peirce's sense, is a hypothesis about action, that is continuously designed through use. That is, designing is a learning process like any other.
