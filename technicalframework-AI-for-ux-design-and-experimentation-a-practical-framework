--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This framework describes a realistic, production-grade system for using AI 
agents to design, test, and iteratively improve software user experiences 
through controlled experimentation.

1. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agent Roles and Responsibilities
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

** Research Agent **

  • Analyzes user behavior data (analytics, session recordings, support tickets)
  • Identifies friction points, drop-off patterns, and opportunity areas
  • Synthesizes qualitative feedback into structured insights
  • Maintains a knowledge base of user segments and their behaviors

** UX Design Agent **

  • Generates design hypotheses based on research insights
  • Creates variant designs (wireframes, layouts, copy alternatives)
  • References design system constraints and brand guidelines
  • Documents design rationale and expected impact

** Experiment Design Agent **

  • Translates UX hypotheses into testable experiments
  • Calculates required sample sizes and traffic allocation
  • Defines primary and secondary metrics
  • Sets guardrail metrics (e.g., "conversion must not drop >5%")

** Analysis Agent **

  • Monitors experiments in real-time for early signals
  • Performs statistical analysis when significance is reached
  • Generates reports with actionable recommendations
  • Flags anomalies or unexpected behaviors

** Governance Agent **

  • Ensures experiments meet safety criteria before launch
  • Checks for conflicting experiments or metric pollution
  • Validates statistical rigor and prevents p-hacking
  • Manages experiment portfolio for resource optimization

** Orchestrator Agent **

  • Coordinates workflow between specialized agents
  • Manages state across the experimentation lifecycle
  • Handles error recovery and rollback procedures
  • Escalates to humans based on predefined rules

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Communication Pattern
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Agents operate asynchronously through a shared event bus and structured data 
store. Each agent publishes results to specific topics (e.g., research.insights, 
experiments.results) and subscribes to inputs they need. This loose coupling 
allows agents to be upgraded independently.

2. UX DESIGN WORKFLOW
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 1: Insight Gathering (Research Agent)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Research Agent operates on a continuous loop:

1. Quantitative Analysis: Queries analytics database for:
  • Funnel conversion rates by segment
  • Time-on-task metrics
  • Error rates and retry patterns
  • Feature adoption curves

2. Qualitative Synthesis: Processes:
  • Support ticket clustering (common pain points)
  • Session replay sampling (targeted at drop-off points)
  • User interview transcripts (if available)
  • NPS feedback categorization

3. Opportunity Scoring: Ranks issues by:
  • Impact (users affected × severity)
  • Feasibility (engineering complexity estimate)
  • Alignment (strategic priority scoring)

Learning, Human-in-the-Loop Controls, Safeguards, and Practical Examples...]
